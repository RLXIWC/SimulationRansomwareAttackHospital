# 🏥 Hospital Cyberattack Simulation & Data Analysis (Master Thesis)

This repository contains all the components of my Master Thesis project, which models and analyzes the effects of a **cyberattack** on a hospital using a **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** approach in **AnyLogic**. The goal is to simulate operational disruptions and quantify their impact on hospital performance, supported by extensive **Monte Carlo simulations** and **Python-based data analysis**.
